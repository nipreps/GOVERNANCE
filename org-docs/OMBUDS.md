# Ombuds team

## Role and responsibilities

Ombuds serve voluntarily for as long as they are willing to sustain their commitment (see eligibility requirements below). Ombudspersons of the NiPreps Community have two primary responsibilities:

  1. to serve as a point of contact to receive reports and listen to individuals and groups involved in the NiPreps Community to assist them in determining the options to resolve conflicts, miscommunication issues, violations of the Code of Conduct, or any unacceptable behavior by member(s) of this community.
  1. to bring systemic concerns to the attention of the NiPreps Steering Committee for resolution.

The NiPreps Ombuds team is guided by the [Code of Ethics](https://www.ombudsassociation.org/assets/IOA%20Code%20of%20Ethics.pdf) of the International Ombudsman Association (IOA).

Ombuds consultations are confidential; only in the case of imminent risk or serious harm may your identity be disclosed or your concerns discussed with anyone without your explicit permission.

The Ombuds team is not responsible for making decisions or taking actions on behalf of the community, but rather serves as a resource for community members who are seeking assistance in resolving issues or concerns.

## Requirements for Ombuds

Effective ombuds are active listeners, able to communicate successfully, and remain nonjudgmental, especially at the initial stages of a report when an individual has taken the courageous step of speaking out.
At subsequent stages, ombuds demonstrate their problem-solving and conflict-resolution skills, driven to understand all positions deeply.
Although specific training is recognized and encouraged, the *NiPreps Community* needs more resources to provide formal training, and therefore, specific training is optional to serve as Ombuds.

### Neutrality and Independence

It is fundamental for ombudspersons to be neutral. The most obvious proof of neutrality is that ombuds are not simultaneously involved in any capacity within the *NiPreps Community*. As Ombuds, they do not participate in the decision-making or provide advisory services to the different organisms and committees of the institution. Formerly active members who are now inactive are welcome to become Ombuds.

To ensure the Ombuds team's neutrality and independence, the following guidelines will be followed:

* Ombudspersons should not be members of the NiPreps Steering Committee (NSC) or any other NiPreps governance body (e.g., project maintainers, PIs, etc.).
* Ombudspersons should have no conflict of interest with respect to the community or its members.
* Ombudspersons should be neutral and impartial in their approach to disputes or conflicts that arise, however are ready to take actions to protect members of the community at imminent risk.
* Ombudspersons should not engage in any activity that could compromise their neutrality or independence, including serving as a spokesperson for the community or engaging in any fundraising or advocacy activities on behalf of the community.
* Ombudspersons are invited to participate in the Community assemblies (*NiPreps bi-monthly Roundups*), however they cannot take part of nonsecret votings. Should an Ombudsperson be present at the voting, the voting must be executed secretly.

## Term Limits

Ombudspersons will serve a term of up to two years, with the possibility of one additional term renewal. After serving two consecutive terms, Ombudspersons must take a break of at least one year before being eligible to serve again.

The NiPreps Community is committed to supporting the work of the Ombuds team and to working collaboratively to address any concerns or issues that are brought to their attention.
